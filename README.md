- **Lexilia - AI-Powered Legal RFP Platform**: Developed a web platform ([Lexilia](https://lexilia.net)) for assisting General Counsels in major companies to hire the most suitable law firm (legaltech startup). The platform includes:
  - Request for Proposal ('RFP') module that collects data from client users via an RFP form and generates RFP text.
  - Recommendation module that suggests the most relevant law firms from a Neo4j database using embeddings and graph features.
  - Pitch module that collects responses to RFPs from law firms.
  - Analysis module that evaluates client requirements against law firm pitches and scores firms based on a set of features.
  - Data crawler, scraper, and feature extraction pipeline.

**What I'm working on now**
- Building ML-based semantic search solutions
- Exploring RAG applications for legal document analysis
- Contributing to open-source NLP projects
